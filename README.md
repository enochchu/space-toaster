# Space Toaster

## Goals

The goal of Space Toasters is to provide a simple experience in planning and designing a system that impliments Modular Open Systems Approach.

Think of this project as an exploration of a Bob Ross guide to systems engineering with the intent that you don't have to know engineering jargon to design a system.

## Why did we started Space Toasters?

Space Toaster is an exploration of designing a system that can conform to technical specifications and expectations that would be easy to understand for everyone.

## Open Contribution

Tasks, issues, and changes will be tracked by Github Issues.

## Interested?

We need all the talent we can get - from engineers to storytellers to artists! You can even be a high schooler and just read our stuff to make sure that it makes sense.
